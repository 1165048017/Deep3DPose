### Introduction

Our work was initially described in an [arXiv tech report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02703) and will appear as a 3D Vision 2016 paper. Deep3DPose is a scalable human image synthesis pipeline for generating millions of human images with their corresponding 2D and 3D pose annotations. These training images can be used for high-capacity models such as deep CNNs.
