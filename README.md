# Deep 3D Pose

This is part of code which allows one to generate huge images with corresponding 2D and 3D annotations.
This is an extension to Caffe which allows one to reproduce some of the results presented in the paper [Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation](http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/ganin15.pdf) (accepted to 3D Vision 2016, Oral).

## How to use

This code needs to be run in Windows environment, because it uses a dll library.
